//Code
public class Myclass
{
final static int x;

static {
x = 10;
}
public static void main(String[]
args) {
System.out.println(x);
}
}

//Output
10

// Reason
When Myclass class loads in the main memory static block is executed, 
here 'x' is initialized as 10 in the static block.
When System.out.println(x) is called output 10 is printed
